\# Rainbow-Six-Ubisoft-Simulated-DataBase



This project simulates a simplified database for a fictional Ubisoft game — \*Rainbow Six Siege X\* — created for practicing SQL queries and database design in MySQL Workbench.



It contains tables for players and transactions, plus analytical queries to explore user behavior and revenue patterns.  

Each .sql file begins with a short explanation of its purpose.

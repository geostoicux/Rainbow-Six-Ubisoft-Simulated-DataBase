/* This project simulates a simplified database for a fictional Ubisoft - Rainbow Six Siege X, online game, created for practicing SQL queries
and database design in MySQL Workbench.
It contains tables for players and transactions, plus analytical queries to explore user behavior and revenue patterns.
You will find the exact description of what the files are interogating at the beginning of the code inside each file.

Files:

databasecreation.sql - Creates the database and main tables.
playerTable.sql - Inserts simulated player data.
transactionTable.sql - Inserts simulated purchase transactions.
dailyRevenue.sql - Aggregates daily revenue from transactions.
SpendingBehav.sql - Analyzes spending patterns of players.
TOP3bundles.sql - Finds the top 3 purchased bundles.
payingUserDESC.sql - Lists paying users in descending order of spend.
MailerCampaign.sql - Creates CRM-style player segments for marketing.
ubisoft.sql - Combined master script for running the full project.

Disclaimer:

All data is fictional and for educational purposes only.
The real Ubisoft databases are more complex; this is a simplified version for learning. */
